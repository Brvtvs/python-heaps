I wrote this code to mess around with heaps in python to refresh myself on both. This is nothing special; there are a many implementations of heaps in pretty much every language. 

These heaps are implemented from scratch based on abstract knowledge of the data structures without looking at anyone else's implementations.

Data structures are fun.
